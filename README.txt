Futuristic Materials  by TheNumenorean
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A mod designed to offer materials which are useful and look good for building futuristic buildings, starships,etc.

This mod is the result of my getting tired of building ships for use with WarpDrive out of purely Reinforced Stone.
Starships in movies, videogames, etc. do not generally look like a greyish mound, and so this mod will help you build better-looking ships.

The materials in this mod are not designed only for cosmetics and creative worlds. The materials have durability and explosion
resistences, which are decided upon based on the material and reinforement done to them. The server this is developed for and with 
takes pride in building ships that actually go to war with each other, and the armour is real and useful. If you have opinions on
strengths of the blocks, feel free to share them.


You will probably notice that the base textures are terrible. If you would like to help, you are more than welcome to, we especially need texture artists and modelers, but programmers are also welcome. 

This mod is designed with WarpDrive support built-in, so you never have to worry about compatibility. (originally these items were just going to be added to it but i decided that it would be better to seperate them for sanities sake)
